app.js
========

A packager for turning node modules into browser apps.

App.js packages web apps based on a JavaScript file, not an HTML file. All HTML must be generated by JavaScript, either on the client or the server.  All JavaScript dependencies are traced via require statements and can be compressed and inlined in the HTML.  Consequently, Node.js and NPM are used to package and distribute modules that can be used in a web browser or Node.

App.js can run as a web server or a command-line packager.

App.js can package apps intended for the web, or bundle native apps for the desktop or phones using an embedded browser.

Status
------

App.js is a work-in-progress and is only intended for my personal use at this time.

Installation
------------

    $ npm install appjs (someday! not in registry yet)
